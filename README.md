# HowI Solved Myself
## The Aaron Gonzales Story

My name is Aaron Matthew Gonzales and this is what I think happened to my family...

I started to think I was going to die a few months ago so I started to ask myself 1 question: "Do I really want to wait till I see god before I tell him 'My bad, yo'?" That question has completely changed my life.

I went on a searching inner journey and I kept pondering these profound questions which I probably will never go into, find a human as curious as me and you might get him to spill the beans. Not I, I would rather live in a world where ther only exist 1 Aaron Gonzales. Waking up and teaching an army of you would be exhilirating but at the same time it would damage my soul so irreprably that I would have to make ammends till the end of time to fix what little me's had wrought on the Universe. No this is an Aaron Gonzales unseen by the world in 33-34 years. This is a wide eyed little boy ready to question god without filter or restraint or even defference to his own safty. With that in mind I will breifely go over the process I started to Solve Myself. 

## The Solution was so Easy

I am a problem solver by nature. I am the kind of person who looks at a problem and thinks there are 2 ways to solve it. Then after my mind has the two solutions it does a cross product with the steps to see if there are different ways to come to the same conclustion. I know, Cross Product? what kinda jargon am I going to be reading. Mostly I use my words for effect so if you see me using words people normally do not use then please do not make an ass out of you and me. Let's just say that I am a punny guy who likes to drop hints as to what is to come. And if you speak my "language" you might find out that the concepts I am trying to get through with eloquence are magnified when I tie them to conceptual ideas found in Math and Science. Why Aaron do you operate like this, and yes I really do mean Operate. I am complex. I am something that is so terrifying my mind's only safety mechanism is to cut my brain power down by many magnifcations as to be able to be tolerated by those around me. I just came out of a CTS which I think stands for Crisis Trauma Stabilization Center, that experiece was not to different from many other times in my life. I am having a problem my loved ones do not believe me so I annoy them all until they do what I want. Now this is sub conscious mind you. I am quite capabale of burning down the world around me on my own. But that is where the story gets super messy. Who Am I? Am I a little boy trying to get out to show the world how good he is? Am I a Man dealing with tragedy and no one around me wants to admit that I am sane and this awful thing happened to me because like me they were blacking it out and now are being violently shoved into realizing im not whistling dixie. So lets move past those thoughts and just get the train on the track fill up the coal and toot toot our happy asses out of here. I seriously am cursing to tell you children that this might be written from the point of view of a child at some points but it is in no means a childrens story. My story starts about 2 months ago when my Aunt Elvia was about to have a party to celebrate her 65th birthday and wanted to the family to come and wish her well. 

## The Party 

By no means do I ever intend to accuse anyone of anything. All i have are broken memories but the tale I could weave together from these broken memories are so tragic I strain from breaking down and crying. wait, wait, don't, stop, breathe, listen to the music, breathe. Its going to be alright me. Okay the tears are barley streaming down my face and I am just slightly skewed and need to wipe my glasses. I swear i come up with new stuff for things all the time. I would rub the back of my hand knock my glasses to wipe my tears. Now I just rand my fore fingers to the crease in my eyes and wiped the streaming tears down my face to wick them away. I dont even know that im doing new stuff till i stop and say oh shit thats what I would do when I was 5 just find a different way to do everything. Once I found the different ways I put them together to make the fastest easiest way I could. You should see me fold button up shirts its so good you would say, "fuck i wish i could flip and rotate in my head". Or turn out an inside out t-shirt. It takes me 1 motion to go from inside out to right side and folded in another 2 motions. But again you will realize I am annoying you. This is what I do. I am taking so much time and effort to dance around the subject that I am actually thinking if i spew so much garbage on this page that people will have to do the work themselves and decide what is the story and what is the annoying bits Aaron is using to not talk about the thing he needs to talk about. So, my mom comes to me and a little back ground on I am a 39 year old man who moved back home during COVID, got sober. Controlled my adictions and deviations and have been trying to make up for a life I beileved gave them great harm. So like I was saying my mom comes to me and says, "You are going to Elvia's 65th birthday, that is the least you can do for us." That shocks me so bad that I'm like yeah I'll go say hi and leave. I start thinking about that abysmal family and start wondering why am I so hurt by them. It can't be how they treated Elisa, or how Charles treated me can it? Push those thoughts out of your head Aaron just play a video game all day and all night and everything will be fine. So that's what I did until the big day came up. I met my sisters potential, not really sure once all this comes out, fiance. I madew wontons which I called Won-Rita's for Won-ton and Burrita (a punny name we give food at my house). I "performed" for my favorite teacher Mrs. Perbetsky, but when the time came I made up some excuse and didnt go. The strangest thing happened my brother made up an excuse and I was like what the fuck? Why doesn't Adam want to go he goes over there all the time and works for them and everything. I started to think really hard, was what my mom told me when I was 9 really true? Were we just playing doctor or did something nefarius happen to me. 

## The House Warming

Things started to work after that party and it all settled for a bit but my mind has a way of solving problems when they are just sitting on the "tip of my tounge" so to speak. So thats what it did it went to work and the fisrt thing it went to work on was my mortality. I started to believe that I am human, I wont live forever, and when I die what am I going to say to my love ones if I cant even tell god. I am not religious or spiritual. My beliefs are in Mathematics so I think what we think of as god might be some extra dimensional entity that is beyond the stars like Beethoven said in Ode to Joy. So my mind just started to work out questions about myself. Is it okay for me to hit Amy when she takes my toy or am I responsible for my deeds. I posit that we are not a collection of our good deeds or our bad deeds. Everyone has that "coming to jesus" moment where they realize that god is only going to judge me on my deeds not what other people did to me. So if you go along that logic, you need to seriously be honest with yourself and identify what those issues really are. Like why did I get angry over a toy? Was it because Amy feels like my things are her's and her things are her's so when she takes sometihing I am using I autmoatically need to fight for it so she leaves it alone? Do I feel inferior to her because they all believe they invested into the right stock. They cultured the right flower and left the most beautiful once in a lifetime blooming plant to die under thier manuer? No it's none of that shit, its seriously that Aaron you took her toy she wanted it back you thought it was yours and you felt entitled and boom shit happened. Stop lying to yourselves to make yourselves feel better. It is a band-aid for your psyche. Yeah you can live today and tomorrow, but at some point you will experience stress, and that stress will bring everything up to the surface. So I had a feeling something was wrong with my family when I started to think I was taken advantage of by Elvia's wife Craig and her eldest daughter Rachel. I was told that what I was doing was just playing doctor, everyone does it. Well, if everyone does it why is there a camera involved. Why is an 18 month old baby involved? Why are we naked? All these questions started to make me realize there is a huge chunk of time that is removed from my mind. It is like from 3-9 years old. Not saying that anyone should remember those years but I only have 3 terrible memeories from those years and I believe that if i can go thorugh the memories completely that I will have unlocked all the good memories that are trapped near these terrible memeories. So my sister bought a house and I was the "Chef" they say chef but what they really mean is Aaron has been cooking for so long and it taste good that we just let him do everything for use cause he does it all and we dont have to do anything. My cooking has gotten better but as to my standard I am at a short order cook level of culinary skill. So I got really drunk and tried to sleep it off. Well I'll tell you what I actually started the process of healing that night. I didn't lie to myself. I forgave myself for the guilt I was holding on to. And I truly apologized with my heart and sould to my god. Stop it Aaron. You cannot keep writting if you are crying thats just good manners for the audience. Okay back to present. Once I did that honest recoloection realized I needed to apologize to my god for my wrong doing I started to come to terms with what those monsters did to me and my cousins and possible to my borther and sister. It was a rough night but I got through it. 

## Only God Can Tell some things in this world Mom

I know a powerful line but after the house warming, the 3 memories started to come back up in clearer and clearer detail. I am getting a very frightening picture in my mind about abuse and I want to tell the only person who I think loves me the way I would like to be loved. What a terrible idea that was. As soon as I said the title of the Chapter her eyes flushed completely read and I could tell if you do this like this without her getting used to the idea you will kill her. So like a frog in a pot of water I gently turned up the heat on my mom. It has taken about 3-4 weeks of subtly dropping hints to my mother so that she can come to terms with it. Once I let it all out they wanted to commit me to a psychiatric facility and have me held for 3 days involuntarily. Well to try and lock up a sane person because you don't believe them is a terrible thing to do to anyone. Let alone to an intelligent person. I did not lie to anyone. I told everyone with complete sincerity. I am dealing with Neanderthals and they would rather lock me up than believe what I am saying to get 3 minors some help. That is the stupid that I have had to live my whole life around. I am starting to regain my memory completely and the story I am going to finish is going to be the worse possible case senario and I believe that that may infact be the reality that I was rased in. So they tell me, don't take your phone Aaron they will consfiscate it. So stupid to listen to people who are highly limited in thier capacity.
